## Quick Intro

This course is an introduction to machine learning basics theory and practice. There are 3 different types of learning:

### Supervised learning
supervised learning is maybe the most common modern way of teaching. In this method a "Teacher" shows you an example
and you are required to repeat the example logic on some other examples.
