## Quick Intro

This course is an introduction machine learning basics theory and practice. Learning is a general word refers to decision making using previews knowledge. There are 3 different types of learning:

### Supervised learning
supervised learning is maybe the most common modern way of teaching. In this method some "Teacher" shows you an example
and you are required to repeat the example logic on some other examples.

## Linear regression 

equations:

```math
a^2+b^2=c^2
```
Let $\text{S}_1(N) = \sum_{p=1}^N \text{E}(p)$

$E = mc^2$


$$
\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x}}{n}
$$ 

here the sum is taken over all pixels. Here is the procedure visualized:
